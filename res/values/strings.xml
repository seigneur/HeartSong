        1) Put your arm on a flat surface like a table.\n
        2) Hold the phone with that arm and put your index finger on the lens of the camera.\n
        3) After 10 seconds you will see a numeric reading on the top left hand side
of the screen (That is heart rate reading in beats per minute).\n
4) According to the value of the heart rate, you will hear a song of lower tempo to relax your mind and normalize your heart rate.\n
5) In case you would like to listen to another song or retake the heart rate reading, you can press the shuffle button on the top right corner.\n
6) Once you press the shuffle button, you have to put your finger on the lens of the camera again and wait for 10 seconds. (You will get a new reading and a new song will play accordingly)\n

Important Note: Please understand that Heart song is not a replacement for a medically certified Heart monitoring device. Neither are the songs a qualified treatment for abnormal heart rate.
