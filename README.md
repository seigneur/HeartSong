HeartSong
=========

• Put your arm on a flat surface like a table.
•	Hold the phone with that arm and put your index finger on the lens of the camera.
•	After 10 seconds you will see a numeric reading on the top left side of the screen (That is the heart rate reading in beats per minute).
•	According to the value of the heart rate, you will hear a song of lower tempo to relax your mind and normalize your heart rate.
•	In case you would like to listen to another song or retake the heart rate reading, you can press the shuffle button on the top right corner.
•	Once you press the shuffle button, you have to put your finger on the lens of the camera again and wait for 10 seconds. (You will get a new reading and a new song will play accordingly)

Important Note: Please understand that Heart song is not a replacement for a medically certified Heart monitoring device. Neither are the songs a qualified treatment for abnormal heart rate.
